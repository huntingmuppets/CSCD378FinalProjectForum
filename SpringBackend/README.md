I made the admin, the password is admin. Everything should be fully working, although I did not rigorously test everything. I think everything should have the same naming conventions for the most part, and you should only have to look at the GetMapping annotations in the controllers in each object (in SpringBackend/src/main/java/com/fourumscore/forum/) to understand what is happening and redirect to the right url. Hopefully everything works and is easy enough! If you need me to explain, add, or change anything just ping me on the discord and I'll try to help.
